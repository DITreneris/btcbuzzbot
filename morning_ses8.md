# Morning Session 8: Stabilization Checkpoint & Automated Testing Plan

## 1. Session Goal

Confirm application stability after recent scheduler fixes, verify the updated 6-time tweet schedule (06:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 22:00 UTC), decide on the news analysis strategy, and establish a plan for introducing automated tests to improve robustness and prevent regressions.

## 2. Current Status Recap (as of Apr 27th, ~04:30 UTC)

*   **Scheduler Stability:** Believed to be stable. The worker dyno now correctly starts using `src/scheduler_cli.py`, initializing the `AsyncIOScheduler` engine. Conflicting old scheduler code (`src/scheduler.py`) has been removed.
*   **Posting Logic:** The scheduled task (`src/scheduler_tasks.py :: post_tweet_and_log`) now correctly calls the main posting function (`src/main.py :: post_btc_update`), ensuring the intended logic (16:00 price-only, news checks, fallbacks) is used.
*   **Schedule Update:** The schedule configuration in the live database was updated via `heroku run update_schedule.py` to include 6 posting times: `06:00,08:00,12:00,16:00,20:00,22:00`.
    *   **Verification Pending:** Waiting for the next run of `reschedule_tweet_jobs` in the worker logs (expected after ~04:30 UTC) to confirm it reads the new 6-time schedule from the DB and updates the active jobs.
    *   **Verification Pending:** Waiting for the next scheduled posting time (06:00 UTC or 08:00 UTC) to confirm the `post_tweet_and_log` task executes successfully.
*   **News Fetching:** Remains limited by the Twitter API v2 free tier monthly cap. New news data is likely not being fetched. Analysis tasks will operate on stale data.
*   **Database Refactoring:** `ContentRepository` extracted from `Database`. Other potential extractions (Price, News, Post, Status) remain optional.
*   **Content Management:** Backend methods exist in `ContentRepository`, but no Admin UI for managing quotes/jokes yet.

## 3. Review of Recent Fixes (Apr 27th)

*   **Issue:** Tweets stopped; scheduler logs showed jobs being added but not executed.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  Corrected `Procfile` worker command from `python scheduler.py start` to `python src/scheduler_cli.py start`.
    2.  Modified `src/scheduler_tasks.py :: post_tweet_and_log` to call `src/main.py :: post_btc_update`, passing the `scheduled_time_str`.
    3.  Deleted the old, conflicting `src/scheduler.py`.
    4.  Updated the live schedule config in the database to include 06:00 and 22:00 UTC using a temporary script (`update_schedule.py`) run via `heroku run`.
    5.  Updated the default schedule in `src/database.py` methods (`_create_tables_postgres`, `_create_tables_sqlite`) for future consistency.

## 4. Phase 2 Progress & Next Steps

Let's revisit the Phase 2 plan from `morning_ses7.md`:

*   **Step 2.1: Define News Analysis Usage Strategy (Decision Still Needed)**
    *   **Goal:** Decide how to use significance/sentiment/summary data.
    *   **Options Recap:** A) Dedicated Summary Tweets, B) Influence Existing Tweet Tone, C) Admin Panel Insight First, D) Hybrid.
    *   **Recommendation Recap:** Start with C (Admin Panel) or A (Dedicated Summary) for safety. Option C provides visibility before affecting live tweets.
    *   **Action:** **Discuss and finalize the chosen strategy.** This unblocks Step 2.3.

*   **Step 2.2: Implement Content Management (Quotes/Jokes) (Partially Done)**
    *   **Goal:** Admin UI for managing quotes/jokes.
    *   **Status:** Backend logic moved to `ContentRepository`. Admin routes/UI in `app.py`/`templates/admin.html` still needed.
    *   **Action:** Implement the Flask routes and Jinja2 template forms/tables for adding/deleting/viewing quotes and jokes in the `/admin` section. This is a relatively isolated and lower-risk feature to implement next.

*   **Step 2.3: Implement Chosen News Analysis Feature (Blocked)**
    *   **Goal:** Develop the feature based on the Step 2.1 decision.
    *   **Action:** Defer until Step 2.1 is decided.

*   **Step 2.4: Enhance Admin Panel (Blocked/Partial)**
    *   **Goal:** Consolidate features and improve usability.
    *   **Action:** Can implement the UI for Step 2.2 now. Defer news analysis display until Step 2.3 is done.

*   **Step 2.5: Improve Logging & Monitoring (Ongoing)**
    *   **Goal:** Increase visibility.
    *   **Action:** Continue adding relevant logs as new features (like Content Management UI) are developed. We saw the benefit of detailed logs during the scheduler debugging.

## 5. Introducing Automated Testing

To improve stability and catch regressions introduced by future changes (like refactoring or new features), we should introduce automated tests.

*   **Goal:** Increase confidence in code changes, reduce manual verification time, prevent recurring bugs.
*   **Strategy:** Start with Unit Tests for core, isolated components. Gradually expand coverage.
*   **Tools:** Use `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` (already in `requirements.txt`). Use Python's built-in `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for mocking dependencies (like database calls or external APIs).
*   **Initial Test Targets (Suggestions):**
    1.  **`src/db/content_repo.py`:** Test `add_quote`, `get_all_quotes`, `delete_quote`, `get_random_content` (might require mocking DB connection or using a test DB). Test both SQLite and Postgres logic if feasible.
    2.  **`src/price_fetcher.py`:** Test `calculate_price_change`.
    3.  **Utility Functions:** Any pure helper functions (e.g., time parsing, data validation) are good candidates for simple unit tests.
    4.  **`src/content_manager.py`:** Test `get_random_content` logic, mocking the call to `repo.get_random_content`.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  ~~Create a `tests/` directory.~~
    2.  Write test files (e.g., `tests/db/test_content_repo.py`) within the existing `tests/` directory.
    3.  Run tests locally using `pytest` before committing/pushing changes.
    4.  (Future) Integrate test execution into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) if desired.

## 6. Immediate Actions

1.  **Monitor Logs:** Confirm `reschedule_tweet_jobs` loads the 6-time schedule after ~04:30 UTC.
2.  **Monitor Logs:** Confirm `post_tweet_and_log` executes successfully at the next scheduled time (06:00 or 08:00 UTC).
3.  **Decide:** Finalize the News Analysis Usage Strategy (Step 2.1).
4.  **Develop:** Start implementing the Admin UI for Content Management (Step 2.2 Frontend).
5.  **Develop:** Start writing initial unit tests for `src/db/content_repo.py` (Step 5).

## 7. Guiding Principles (Reiteration)

*   **Stability First:** Prioritize maintaining the current working state.
*   **Incremental Steps:** Implement changes in small, verifiable units.
*   **Test Locally:** Verify changes locally before deploying. Run automated tests.
*   **Clear Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages.
