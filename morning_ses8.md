# Morning Session 8: Stabilization Checkpoint & Automated Testing Plan

## Progress Update (as of 2025-05-21, 07:40 EET)

- **App Status:** Stable and fully operational across all platforms (Twitter, Discord, Telegram).
- **Scheduler:** All scheduled posts are executing on time.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL schema updated; all required columns (significance_label, sentiment_label, etc.) are present in `news_tweets`.
- **Multi-Platform Posting:** Confirmed successful posting to Twitter, Discord, and Telegram (see Heroku logs for 2025-05-20 22:00 UTC and after).
- **News Analysis:** No unprocessed news tweets found (as expected); fallback to quotes/jokes is working as designed.
- **Error Resolution:**
    - Previous error (`psycopg2.errors.UndefinedColumn: column "significance_label" does not exist`) is now resolved after manual schema migration.
    - No critical errors in logs; only expected fallback behavior.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Continue monitoring for any new issues.
    - Optionally, seed more news data for analysis if desired.

## 1. Session Goal

Confirm application stability after recent scheduler fixes, verify the updated 6-time tweet schedule (06:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 22:00 UTC), decide on the news analysis strategy, and establish a plan for introducing automated tests to improve robustness and prevent regressions.

## 2. Current Status Recap (as of May 20th, ~13:14 UTC)

*   **Scheduler Stability:** **Confirmed Stable**. **Reschedule task fixed to run only once on startup (v150).**
*   **Posting Logic:** **Confirmed Stable**. Logic updated to use news/fallback for all times (16:00 special case removed).
*   **News Fetching/Analysis:** **Confirmed Stable (v136)**.
*   **Schedule Update:** Default schedule updated in code (`src/database.py`). **Live schedule update via script successful. Reschedule task verified reading new schedule (v146).**
*   **Database Refactoring:** **Verified Stable (v136)**.
*   **Content Management:** Backend OK, **Admin UI Deployed & Verified (v137)**.
*   **Discord Posting:** **Implemented & Deployed (v142). Config/NameError Fixes Deployed (v146/v147). Verified Working (v148).**
*   **News Analysis Display:** **Implemented & Deployed (v149). Verified Working (v149).**
*   **Telegram Posting:** **Implemented & Deployed (v150). Unit Tests Passing.**
*   **Automated Testing:** **Expanded to cover NewsRepository and Telegram integration (v150).**

## 3. Review of Recent Fixes (Apr 27th)

*   **Issue:** Tweets stopped; scheduler logs showed jobs being added but not executed.
*   **Resolution:**
    1.  Corrected `Procfile` worker command from `python scheduler.py start` to `python src/scheduler_cli.py start`.
    2.  Modified `src/scheduler_tasks.py :: post_tweet_and_log` to call `src/main.py :: post_btc_update`, passing the `scheduled_time_str`.
    3.  Deleted the old, conflicting `src/scheduler.py`.
    4.  Updated the live schedule config in the database to include 06:00 and 22:00 UTC using a temporary script (`update_schedule.py`) run via `heroku run`.
    5.  Updated the default schedule in `src/database.py` methods (`_create_tables_postgres`, `_create_tables_sqlite`) for future consistency.
    *   **Note:** The `AttributeError` fixed on Apr 28th concerning `NewsRepository` reappeared in `main.py` (fixed in v128). A separate `AttributeError` related to `_analyze_single_tweet` appeared in `news_analyzer.py` (fixed locally, persisted in v134 deployment, re-deployed in v135).

## 4. Phase 2 Progress & Next Steps

Let's revisit the Phase 2 plan from `morning_ses7.md`:

*   **Step 2.1: Define News Analysis Usage Strategy (Decision Made: Option C)**
    *   **Goal:** Decide how to use significance/sentiment/summary data.
    *   **Options Recap:** A) Dedicated Summary Tweets, B) Influence Existing Tweet Tone, C) Admin Panel Insight First, D) Hybrid.
    *   **Decision:** **Option C (Admin Panel Insight First)** selected. We will focus on parsing and displaying the analysis data in the admin panel before using it in live tweets.

*   **Step 2.2: Implement Content Management (Quotes/Jokes) (Deployed & Verified)**
    *   **Goal:** Admin UI for managing quotes/jokes.
    *   **Status:** Backend logic moved to `ContentRepository`. Admin routes/UI in `src/app.py` & `templates/admin_content.html` **deployed in v137 and verified working.**
    *   **Action:** None needed for this step. Proceed to next development tasks.

*   **Step 2.3: Implement Chosen News Analysis Feature (Admin Panel Display) (Deployed & Verified v149)**
    *   **Goal:** Parse stored JSON analysis (`news_tweets.llm_raw_analysis`) and display significance, sentiment, and summary in the admin panel.
    *   **Status:** **Deployed (v149) and Verified Working.**
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        1. Enhanced the data parsing in the admin_panel route to support both numeric and string-based sentiment/significance scores
        2. Created a comprehensive News Analysis Statistics section with distribution charts for significance and sentiment
        3. Implemented a sentiment trend chart using Chart.js to visualize sentiment changes over time
        4. Enhanced the news tweet listing with better badges and formatting
        5. Added a dedicated detailed analysis page (`/admin/news/<news_id>`) for in-depth analysis of individual tweets
        6. Added syntax-highlighted JSON viewer for raw analysis data

*   **Step 2.4: Enhance Admin Panel (Ready for News Analysis Display) (Deployed & Verified v149)**
    *   **Goal:** Consolidate features and improve usability.
    *   **Status:** Completed as part of Step 2.3 implementation.
    *   **Actions Taken:**
        1. Added clear visualizations for news analysis data
        2. Improved UI for viewing analyzed tweets
        3. Created dedicated page for detailed tweet analysis
        4. Added direct links between summary views and detailed views

*   **Step 2.5: Improve Logging & Monitoring (Ongoing)**
    *   **Goal:** Increase visibility.
    *   **Action:** Continue adding relevant logs as new features (like Content Management UI) are developed. We saw the benefit of detailed logs during the scheduler debugging.
    *   **Goal:** Fix the `AttributeError` found during the 06:00 UTC post (Apr 28th) and complete the planned database refactoring for news logic.
    *   **Status:** **Deployed (v135), Verified Stable (v136).** Fixes verified by successful analysis cycle run in v136.
    *   **Actions Taken (Locally Complete, Deployed, Verified):**
        1.  Created `src/db/news_repo.py`.
        2.  Moved news-related methods from `src/database.py` to `NewsRepository`.
        3.  Updated `src/main.py :: post_btc_update` to import and use `NewsRepository` for fetching news data. *(Correction applied locally)*.
        4.  Updated `src/news_fetcher.py` (Likely Done).
        5.  Updated `src/news_analyzer.py` (Likely Done).

## 5. Automated Testing Progress (as of May 14th)

Significant progress has been made implementing automated tests to improve stability and catch regressions:

        *   Currently has some failing tests due to mocking issues
    6.  **`tests/test_telegram_poster.py`:** Unit tests for Telegram integration
        *   Coverage for successful posting, error handling, and edge cases
        *   All tests passing

*   **Legacy Test Files Cleanup:**
    These legacy test files have been removed as they are no longer relevant:
    *   `direct_test.py`
    *   `twitter_test.py`
    *   `simple_tweet_test.py`
    *   `new_test_tweet.py`
    *   `simplified_test.py`
    *   `oauth_test.py`
    *   `direct_api_test.py`
    *   `minimal_test.py`

*   **Next Testing Targets:**
    1.  Fix failing tests in `tests/test_main.py`
    2.  Add integration tests between components
    3.  Implement end-to-end tests for the entire posting workflow

## 6. Immediate Actions (Updated May 14th)

1.  **~~Monitor/Verify 18:00 UTC Post:~~** ~~Check logs around 18:00 UTC to verify:~~ **(Verified)**
    *   ~~Job `scheduled_tweet_1800` runs successfully.~~
    *   ~~No `NameError` related to `tweet_text` occurs.~~
    *   ~~Tweet is posted successfully to Twitter.~~
    *   ~~Message is posted successfully to Discord.~~
2.  **~~Develop: News Analysis Admin Display (Step 2.3).~~** **(Completed v149)**
3.  **~~Test: Expand test coverage.~~** **(Completed v150)**
4.  **~~Cleanup: Archive/remove legacy tests.~~** **(Completed v150)**
5.  **~~Fix Scheduler Rescheduling Task Running Every 30 Mins.~~** **(Completed v150)**
6.  **~~Implement Telegram Posting Integration.~~** **(Completed v150)**
7.  **Fix: Address main.py test failures.**
8.  **Deploy v150 to production and verify functionality.**

## 7. Current Issues

*   **~~Scheduler Rescheduling Task Running Every 30 Mins (Previously thought Fixed v148 - Reopened):~~** ~~`src/scheduler_engine.py` appears to still be scheduling `reschedule_tweet_jobs` with an interval trigger instead of running it only once at startup. Logs confirm repeated execution.~~ **(Fixed v150)**
*   **Test Failures in main.py:** The tests for `src/main.py` currently fail due to issues with mocking async functions. This doesn't affect production functionality but needs to be addressed for improved test coverage.
*   **Twitter API Rate Limit:** Status unknown. Analysis is now running, needs monitoring over time.
*   **~~Legacy Tests: Cluttering root directory.~~** **(Resolved v150)**

## 8. Guiding Principles (Reiteration)

*   **Stability First:** Prioritize maintaining the current working state.
*   **Incremental Steps:** Implement changes in small, verifiable units.
*   **Test Locally:** Verify changes locally before deploying. Run automated tests.
*   **Clear Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages.

## Phase 3: Platform Expansion

Goals for this phase involve extending the bot's reach to other platforms and enhancing its interactive capabilities.

*   **Step 3.1: Implement Discord Posting (via Webhooks) (Implemented & Verified v148)**
    *   **Goal:** Post the same BTC update messages to a designated Discord channel.
    *   **Approach:** Use Discord Webhooks for simplicity in sending messages without needing a full bot client initially.
    *   **Status:** Code implemented. Deployed in v142. Config vars set. `AttributeError` fixed in v146. `NameError` fixed in v147. Scheduler rescheduling fixed in v148. **Verified working.**
    *   **Tasks (Completed):**
        1.  Create a Discord Webhook URL for the target channel. (Done by User)
        2.  Add `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and `ENABLE_DISCORD_POSTING` to configuration (`config.py`, `.env`, Heroku). (Done by User)
        3.  Create `src/discord_poster.py` with an async function `send_discord_message(webhook_url, message)` using `aiohttp`. (Done)
        4.  In `src/main.py :: post_btc_update`, after successful tweet posting and logging, check `ENABLE_DISCORD_POSTING`. If true, retrieve `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and call `send_discord_message`. Handle potential errors gracefully. (Done, fix for config loading in v146, fix for variable name in v147)
        5.  Add necessary dependencies (`aiohttp`) to `requirements.txt`. (Done)
        6.  Test locally by setting the config flag and URL. (Skipped, testing in prod)
        7.  Deploy and verify logs/Discord channel. (Deployed & Verified v148)

*   **Step 3.2: Implement Telegram Posting (Implemented v150)**
    *   **Goal:** Post updates to a Telegram channel/chat.
    *   **Status:** **Implemented (v150), Awaiting Deployment.**
    *   **Tasks (Completed):**
        1.  Create a Telegram bot via BotFather and obtain API token. (To be done by User)
        2.  Add the bot to the target channel and make it an admin. (To be done by User)
        3.  Create `src/telegram_poster.py` with an async function to send messages using the Telegram Bot API. (Done)
        4.  Implement proper error handling and logging in the Telegram poster. (Done)
        5.  Add Telegram configuration variables to `src/config.py`. (Done)
        6.  Integrate Telegram posting into the main tweet posting workflow in `src/main.py`. (Done)
        7.  Create comprehensive unit tests for the Telegram functionality. (Done)
        8.  Verify tests passing locally. (Done)
    *   **Tasks (Pending):**
        1.  Configure Telegram-related environment variables in production. (Pending)
        2.  Deploy and verify functionality in production. (Pending)

*   **Step 3.3: Explore Interactive Commands (Future)**
    *   **Goal:** Allow users on Discord/Telegram to request data (e.g., `/price`).
    *   **Status:** Not Started. This would likely require switching from Webhooks to full bot clients (`discord.py`, `python-telegram-bot`).

## 9. Update Summary (May 14th, 2025)

The application is now stable and fully operational with enhanced features:

1. **Core Functionality:** Bitcoin price updates are being posted regularly on Twitter following the configured schedule (06:00, 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 14:00, 16:00, 18:00, 20:00, 22:00 UTC).

2. **Discord Integration:** Successfully implemented and stable, all tweets are now simultaneously posted to Discord.

3. **Telegram Integration:** Implementation complete and ready for deployment, allowing price updates to be posted to Telegram channels.

4. **News Analysis Admin Display:** Fully implemented with comprehensive visualizations and detailed analysis views.

5. **Automated Testing:** Significant expansion of test coverage, including new tests for the NewsRepository and Telegram functionality.

6. **Stability Improvements:** Fixed scheduler rescheduling issue and removed legacy test files for a cleaner codebase.

Next steps will focus on fixing the remaining test issues in the main.py module, deploying the Telegram integration to production, and potentially exploring interactive commands for Discord and Telegram as outlined in Step 3.3.

## 11. ML Sentiment Analysis Integration Plan (May 19th Update)

**Overall Goal:** The sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and significance (Low, Medium, High) determined by the Groq LLM (with VADER as fallback for sentiment) should intelligently guide:
1.  **Content Selection:** Whether to use a news item for a tweet.
2.  **Content Framing:** How the tweet is worded, potentially incorporating the summary and reflecting the sentiment.
3.  **Fallback Logic:** When to use quotes/jokes if news is unsuitable or analysis fails.

**Phase 1: Solidify Analysis Output, Fallback, and Storage**

*   **Goal 1.1: Integrate VADER as a Fallback for Groq Sentiment Analysis.**
    *   **Context:** Groq will be the primary analysis engine. VADER will provide sentiment if Groq fails to return a sentiment.
    *   **Task 1.1.1: Modify `_analyze_content_with_llm` in `src/news_analyzer.py`.**
        *   If the Groq API call fails or if the Groq response does not yield a usable "sentiment" (e.g., JSON parsing error, missing sentiment key), call VADER's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` to get a sentiment score for the tweet text.
        *   Map VADER's compound score to "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral" labels and a corresponding numeric score (e.g., compound > 0.05 is Positive, < -0.05 is Negative, else Neutral).
        *   The function should still aim to return the dictionary with "significance", "sentiment", "summary". If Groq provided significance/summary but failed on sentiment, VADER fills in the sentiment. If Groq failed entirely, VADER provides sentiment, and significance/summary might be marked as "N/A" or a default low significance.
    *   **Task 1.1.2: Ensure `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` is initialized in `NewsAnalyzer.__init__` if VADER is available and store it as an instance variable (e.g., `self.vader_analyzer`).**

*   **Goal 1.2: Ensure Consistent & Direct Storage of LLM/Fallback Analysis.**
    *   **Context:** Analysis results (from Groq or VADER fallback) need to be stored consistently and in a way that's easy to query for content selection logic.
    *   **Task 1.2.1: Analyze `NewsRepository.update_tweet_analysis()` in `src/db/news_repo.py`.**
        *   Review how `analysis_data` (dict from Groq/VADER) is currently processed and stored.
    *   **Task 1.2.2: Add new structured columns to the `news_tweets` table.**
        *   In `src/database.py` (for both `_create_tables_postgres` and `_create_tables_sqlite` methods):
            *   Add `significance_label TEXT` (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High").
            *   Add `significance_score REAL` (e.g., mapped numeric value for significance).
            *   Add `sentiment_source TEXT` (e.g., "groq", "vader_fallback").
            *   Ensure `sentiment_label TEXT` and `sentiment_score REAL` are definitely present.
            *   Ensure `summary TEXT` is present.
    *   **Task 1.2.3: Modify `NewsRepository.update_tweet_analysis()` in `src/db/news_repo.py`.**
        *   Enhance this function to parse the `analysis_data` dict.
        *   Directly populate the new/existing structured columns: `sentiment_score`, `sentiment_label`, `sentiment_source`, `significance_label`, `significance_score`, and `summary` in the `news_tweets` table.
        *   Handle cases where significance might be missing (if Groq failed entirely).
        *   Continue to store the full raw JSON from Groq (if available) in `llm_raw_analysis` for auditing/debugging.

**Phase 2: Implement Intelligent Content Selection & Framing (Completed)**

*   **Goal 2.1: Enhance `TweetHandler` (or equivalent logic in `main.py`) for Content Selection. (Completed)**
    *   **Task 2.1.1: Develop criteria for selecting news based on significance and sentiment. (Completed)**
        *   Example: Prioritize "High" or "Medium" significance. For "High" significance, consider tweeting even if sentiment is "Neutral". Avoid "Low" significance news unless other content is unavailable.
        *   Define how sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) influences selection. Perhaps avoid overly negative news unless it's highly significant.
        *   **(Implemented in `src/main.py :: post_btc_update` with significance score thresholds and sentiment checking).**
    *   **Task 2.1.2: Modify `post_btc_update` (or helper functions) to query `news_tweets` using the new structured columns (`significance_label`, `significance_score`, `sentiment_label`, `sentiment_source`) to find suitable news. (Completed)**
        *   **(Modified `NewsRepository.get_recent_analyzed_news` to fetch required columns and order results. Refactored news selection loop in `main.py :: post_btc_update` to use this data).**
*   **Goal 2.2: Implement Content Framing based on Sentiment and Summary. (Completed)**
    *   **Task 2.2.1: Develop tweet templates or logic that incorporate the LLM's summary. (Completed)**
        *   **(Implemented via `_format_news_tweet` helper in `src/main.py` which uses the LLM's summary).**
    *   **Task 2.2.2: Adjust tweet wording/emojis based on `sentiment_label`. (Completed)**
        *   Example: More upbeat language for "Positive" sentiment, cautious for "Negative", neutral for "Neutral".
        *   **(Implemented in `_format_news_tweet` helper in `src/main.py` with varied emojis and templates based on significance/sentiment).**
*   **Goal 2.3: Refine Fallback Logic. (Completed)**
    *   **Task 2.3.1: Clearly define when to fall back to quotes/jokes. (Completed)**
        *   Examples: No suitable news found based on significance/sentiment criteria, Groq and VADER both fail to provide usable analysis, analysis tasks time out.
        *   **(Fallback to quotes/jokes in `main.py :: post_btc_update` now occurs if the new intelligent news selection criteria are not met).**

This provides a structured approach. We will start with Phase 1.
