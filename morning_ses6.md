# Morning Session 6: Stability Consolidation & Strategic Development

## 1. Current Status (as of Apr 24th, ~09:40 UTC)

Following extensive debugging (documented in `morning_ses5.md`), the application has reached a state of **core functional stability**:

*   **Worker Stability:** The `worker` dyno starts reliably, initializes components (Database, NewsFetcher, NewsAnalyzer, TweetHandler), and runs scheduled tasks without the previous crashes related to `SyntaxError` or `AttributeError`.
*   **Core Tweeting Operational:** Scheduled tweets (`post_tweet_and_log` task) are executing successfully at configured times (08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC).
    *   Random content selection (price, quote, joke) is working.
    *   Database interactions (fetching content, storing price, logging posts) are functional, including fixes for `timestamp` column types.
    *   The duplicate post check (`has_posted_recently`) no longer causes type errors.
*   **Web App UI:**
    *   Home page displays the latest price and timestamp correctly.
    *   `/posts` page displays tweet history.
    *   `/admin` page loads and displays basic stats, recent posts, and analyzed news tweets (sentiment/summary). The inaccurate "Next scheduled run" display has been removed.
*   **Rate Limit Mitigation:** Initial steps taken for Twitter news fetching (reduced frequency to 12hrs, reduced tweet count to 5). Job intervals in `scheduler_engine.py` have been partially externalized to environment variables.

## 2. Production Monitoring Points

While core functionality is restored, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure continued stability and identify emerging issues:

*   **Scheduled Tweets (Daily Check):** Verify that tweets continue to post successfully at *all* scheduled times (08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC). Confirm random content types are being used over time. Check the bot's Twitter profile daily.
*   **Twitter API Rate Limits (News Fetch):** Monitor worker logs specifically when the `run_news_fetch_wrapper` job executes (currently every 12 hours). Check if the `tweepy.client - WARNING - Rate limit exceeded` messages reappear. If they do, further mitigation (e.g., longer interval, disabling the fetcher) may be needed.
*   **Groq API Rate Limits (Analysis):** Monitor worker logs for `429 Too Many Requests` errors related to Groq, especially during the `run_analysis_cycle_wrapper` task (currently every 30 mins). Note frequency and impact if errors occur.
*   **Worker Dyno Health:** Periodically check Heroku logs (`heroku logs --tail --app btcbuzzbot --dyno worker`) for any *new* unexpected errors, tracebacks, or crashes.
*   **Web App UI/Data:** Briefly check the Home, Posts, and Admin pages daily to ensure they load correctly and display up-to-date information without errors.

## 3. Development Roadmap: Next Steps

Focus on consolidating stability and addressing remaining cleanup before implementing significant new features from `roadmap.md`.

**Phase 1: Consolidation & Cleanup (Immediate Focus)**

1.  **Complete Configuration Externalization:**
    *   **Goal:** Remove remaining hardcoded values from the codebase for better maintainability and flexibility.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Externalize content type weighting (`TWEET_CONTENT_TYPES` env var?) in `src/scheduler_tasks.py`.
        *   Externalize duplicate post check interval (`DUPLICATE_POST_CHECK_MINUTES` env var?) used in `src/database.py` -> `has_posted_recently`.
        *   Externalize quote/joke reuse interval (`CONTENT_REUSE_DAYS` env var?) used in `src/database.py` -> `get_random_content`.
        *   Review `news_fetcher.py`, `news_analyzer.py`, `tweet_handler.py`, `llm_api.py` for any other obvious hardcoded values (e.g., query strings, model names, API endpoints if not already env vars).
    *   **Verification:** Ensure the application runs correctly using default values and can be configured via new environment variables in `.env` or Heroku Config Vars.

2.  **Address Technical Debt:**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve known warnings and minor issues.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Fix the Flask `before_first_request` deprecation warning in `src/llm_api.py` (likely involves using `app.before_request` or alternative initialization patterns).
        *   (Low Priority) Investigate and fix the `Unclosed client session` warning from `aiohttp` during worker shutdown (likely requires ensuring the `httpx` or `aiohttp` client used by Groq/APIs is properly closed).
    *   **Verification:** Ensure warnings no longer appear in logs.

**Phase 2: Enhancements & Roadmap Integration (Medium Term)**

*   **(Requires `roadmap.md` Review)** Based on the goals outlined in `roadmap.md` and current priorities:
    *   **Refine News Analysis Usage:** How should the generated sentiment/summary be *used*? (e.g., Display trends in admin? Influence tweet content? Generate dedicated summary tweets?). Define the next concrete step for leveraging this data.
    *   **Content Management:** Implement functionality (potentially via admin panel) to add/manage quotes and jokes in the database.
    *   **Admin Panel Improvements:** Add features identified as necessary (e.g., filtering/searching news tweets, viewing full logs, manually triggering analysis).
    *   **Error Handling/Resilience:** Improve error handling in key tasks (e.g., better retry logic, clearer status reporting on failure).

**Phase 3: Future Features (Long Term)**

*   Address larger features from `roadmap.md` once Phases 1 & 2 are complete and stable.

## 4. Guiding Principles

*   **Stability First:** Prioritize maintaining the current working state. Avoid introducing breaking changes.
*   **Incremental Steps:** Implement changes and new features in small, verifiable steps.
*   **Clear Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages linking back to tasks or issues.
*   **Test Locally:** Where possible, test changes locally before deploying to Heroku.

This plan provides a clear path forward, focusing on solidifying the current application before expanding its capabilities. Let me know if this aligns with your vision.
