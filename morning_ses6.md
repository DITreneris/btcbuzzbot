# Morning Session 6: Stability Consolidation & Strategic Development

## 1. Current Status (as of Apr 24th, ~09:40 UTC)

Following extensive debugging (documented in `morning_ses5.md`), the application has reached a state of **core functional stability**:

*   **Worker Stability:** The `worker` dyno starts reliably, initializes components (Database, NewsFetcher, NewsAnalyzer, TweetHandler), and runs scheduled tasks without the previous crashes related to `SyntaxError` or `AttributeError`.
*   **Core Tweeting Operational:** Scheduled tweets (`post_tweet_and_log` task) are executing successfully at configured times (08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC).
    *   Random content selection (price, quote, joke) is working.
    *   Database interactions (fetching content, storing price, logging posts) are functional, including fixes for `timestamp` column types.
    *   The duplicate post check (`has_posted_recently`) no longer causes type errors.
*   **Web App UI:**
    *   Home page displays the latest price and timestamp correctly.
    *   `/posts` page displays tweet history.
    *   `/admin` page loads and displays basic stats, recent posts, and analyzed news tweets (sentiment/summary). The inaccurate "Next scheduled run" display has been removed.
*   **Rate Limit Mitigation:** Initial steps taken for Twitter news fetching (reduced frequency to 12hrs, reduced tweet count to 5). Job intervals in `scheduler_engine.py` have been partially externalized to environment variables.

## 2. Production Monitoring Points

While core functionality is restored, ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure continued stability and identify emerging issues:

*   **Scheduled Tweets (Daily Check):** Verify that tweets continue to post successfully at *all* scheduled times (08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 UTC). Confirm random content types are being used over time. Check the bot's Twitter profile daily.
*   **Twitter API Rate Limits (News Fetch):** Monitor worker logs specifically when the `run_news_fetch_wrapper` job executes (currently every 12 hours). Check if the `tweepy.client - WARNING - Rate limit exceeded` messages reappear. If they do, further mitigation (e.g., longer interval, disabling the fetcher) may be needed.
*   **Groq API Rate Limits (Analysis):** Monitor worker logs for `429 Too Many Requests` errors related to Groq, especially during the `run_analysis_cycle_wrapper` task (currently every 30 mins). Note frequency and impact if errors occur.
*   **Worker Dyno Health:** Periodically check Heroku logs (`heroku logs --tail --app btcbuzzbot --dyno worker`) for any *new* unexpected errors, tracebacks, or crashes.
*   **Web App UI/Data:** Briefly check the Home, Posts, and Admin pages daily to ensure they load correctly and display up-to-date information without errors.

## 3. Development Roadmap: Next Steps

Focus on consolidating stability and addressing remaining cleanup before implementing significant new features from `roadmap.md`.

**Phase 1: Consolidation & Cleanup (Immediate Focus)**

1.  **Complete Configuration Externalization:**
    *   **Goal:** Remove remaining hardcoded values from the codebase for better maintainability and flexibility.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Externalize content type weighting (`TWEET_CONTENT_TYPES` env var?) in `src/scheduler_tasks.py`.
        *   Externalize duplicate post check interval (`DUPLICATE_POST_CHECK_MINUTES` env var?) used in `src/database.py` -> `has_posted_recently`.
        *   Externalize quote/joke reuse interval (`CONTENT_REUSE_DAYS` env var?) used in `src/database.py` -> `get_random_content`.
        *   Review `news_fetcher.py`, `news_analyzer.py`, `tweet_handler.py`, `llm_api.py` for any other obvious hardcoded values (e.g., query strings, model names, API endpoints if not already env vars).
    *   **Verification:** Ensure the application runs correctly using default values and can be configured via new environment variables in `.env` or Heroku Config Vars.

2.  **Address Technical Debt:**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve known warnings and minor issues.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Fix the Flask `before_first_request` deprecation warning in `src/llm_api.py` (likely involves using `app.before_request` or alternative initialization patterns).
        *   (Low Priority) Investigate and fix the `Unclosed client session` warning from `aiohttp` during worker shutdown (likely requires ensuring the `httpx` or `aiohttp` client used by Groq/APIs is properly closed).
    *   **Verification:** Ensure warnings no longer appear in logs.

**Phase 2: Enhancements & Roadmap Integration (Medium Term)**

*   **(Requires `roadmap.md` Review)** Based on the goals outlined in `roadmap.md` and current priorities:
    *   **Refine News Analysis Usage:** How should the generated sentiment/summary be *used*? (e.g., Display trends in admin? Influence tweet content? Generate dedicated summary tweets?). Define the next concrete step for leveraging this data.
    *   **Content Management:** Implement functionality (potentially via admin panel) to add/manage quotes and jokes in the database.
    *   **Admin Panel Improvements:** Add features identified as necessary (e.g., filtering/searching news tweets, viewing full logs, manually triggering analysis).
    *   **Error Handling/Resilience:** Improve error handling in key tasks (e.g., better retry logic, clearer status reporting on failure).

**Phase 3: Future Features (Long Term)**

*   Address larger features from `roadmap.md` once Phases 1 & 2 are complete and stable.

## 4. Guiding Principles

*   **Stability First:** Prioritize maintaining the current working state. Avoid introducing breaking changes.
*   **Incremental Steps:** Implement changes and new features in small, verifiable steps.
*   **Clear Commits:** Use descriptive commit messages linking back to tasks or issues.
*   **Test Locally:** Where possible, test changes locally before deploying to Heroku.

This plan provides a clear path forward, focusing on solidifying the current application before expanding its capabilities. Let me know if this aligns with your vision.

## 5. Session Progress (April 24th - Afternoon)

*   **Configuration Externalization (Completed):**
    *   Finished externalizing remaining configuration values (content weights, duplicate check minutes, content reuse days, news fetcher max results, LLM params, tweet handler settings) to environment variables.
    *   Removed Ollama-specific configuration and related code as Groq is now the primary LLM.
*   **Technical Debt Addressed:**
    *   Fixed Flask `before_first_request` deprecation warning by removing the unused `llm_api.py` entirely.
    *   Obsolete Ollama integration code (`llm_integration.py`, `llm_api.py`) and UI elements were removed, simplifying the codebase.
*   **Roadmap Update:**
    *   Updated `roadmap.md` to reflect the switch to Groq, mark Phase 1 (Consolidation, Groq Integration, Stability) as complete, and refine the focus for Phase 2 (Enhanced Content Generation & Analysis).
*   **News Analysis Refactoring:**
    *   Refactored `NewsAnalyzer` (`src/news_analyzer.py`) to use a single Groq API call for combined analysis (significance, sentiment, summary).
    *   Implemented JSON output parsing for more structured and reliable results.
    *   Added `llm_raw_analysis` TEXT column to `news_tweets` table via `ALTER TABLE` command in Heroku PSQL.
    *   Updated `Database.update_tweet_analysis` (`src/database.py`) to store the raw LLM JSON output.
    *   Added new environment variables (`LLM_ANALYZE_TEMP`, `LLM_ANALYZE_MAX_TOKENS`) to Heroku Config Vars.
    *   Deployed these changes.
*   **Price Change Calculation Fix:**
    *   Identified that the 24h price change was always 0.00% because the calculation logic was missing.
    *   Added `Database.get_price_from_approx_24h_ago` method to `src/database.py` to fetch the price from ~24 hours prior.
    *   Updated `TweetHandler.post_tweet` (`src/tweet_handler.py`) to call the new database method and correctly calculate the `price_change_24h`.
    *   Deployed this fix.
*   **Current Status (End of Session):**
    *   The refactored news analysis code and the price change calculation fix have been deployed to Heroku.
    *   **Next Action:** Monitor the next scheduled tweet job (16:00 UTC) via logs (`heroku logs --tail --app btcbuzzbot --dyno worker`) to verify the price change calculation is working correctly and the tweet displays the accurate percentage change.

## 6. Verification & Further Fixes (April 24th - Late Afternoon)

*   **16:00 UTC Tweet Verification Failure:**
    *   Monitoring logs during the `scheduled_tweet_1600` job revealed two errors:
        1.  **Database Error:** `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedFunction: operator does not exist: text <= timestamp with time zone` occurred in `Database.get_price_from_approx_24h_ago` because the `prices.timestamp` column was incorrectly typed as `TEXT`.
        2.  **Logging Error:** The subsequent `except` block in `get_price_from_approx_24h_ago` failed with `NameError: name 'logger' is not defined`.
    *   **Result:** The price change calculation failed, defaulted to `0.0`, and the tweet was posted with `+0.00%`.
*   **Corrective Actions Taken:**
    1.  **Database Schema Fix:** Connected via `heroku pg:psql` and executed `ALTER TABLE prices ALTER COLUMN timestamp TYPE TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE USING timestamp::timestamp with time zone;` to correct the data type.
    2.  **Logging Fix:** Added `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` to `src/database.py`.
    3.  **Deployment:** Committed (`Fix: Add logger to database.py`) and deployed these fixes to Heroku and pushed to GitHub.
*   **Post-Fix Status:**
    *   Worker dyno restarted successfully around 16:05 UTC after deployment.
    *   Subsequent news analysis cycles (e.g., 15:14, 15:44 UTC) ran without the `AttributeError` related to `update_news_tweet_analysis`, confirming the earlier refactoring fix is active.
    *   **Next Action:** Monitor the **20:00 UTC** scheduled tweet job via logs (`heroku logs --tail --app btcbuzzbot --dyno worker`) to verify that the database type fix and logging fix allow the 24h price change calculation to execute correctly. 
*   **20:00 UTC Tweet Verification SUCCESS:**
    *   Logs confirmed the `scheduled_tweet_2000` job executed without any database or logger errors.
    *   The formatted tweet log showed a correctly calculated non-zero percentage change (e.g., `+0.16%`).
    *   The tweet was successfully posted.
    *   **Result:** The fixes for the `prices.timestamp` data type and the missing logger in `database.py` are confirmed to be working. The 24h price change calculation is now operational.
