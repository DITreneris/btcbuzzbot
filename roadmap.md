# BTCBuzzBot Future Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for BTCBuzzBot, focusing first on consolidating the initial build and integrating the Groq LLM API for enhanced content generation before expanding into more advanced ML/RL capabilities and multi-platform support. The development is structured in phases with realistic timelines and implementation goals.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Consolidation, Groq LLM Integration & Stability (Completed: April 2024)

This phase focused on stabilizing the core application, externalizing configuration, and integrating an external LLM API (Groq) for initial content analysis.

### 1. Core Application Stabilization & Refactoring
- **April 22-23**: Debugged and fixed deployment regressions related to database interactions, asynchronous task execution, scheduler logic, and web application crashes.
- **April 22-23**: Refactored core task components (`NewsFetcher`, `NewsAnalyzer`, `TweetHandler`) for proper initialization, shared database access, and environment variable usage.
- **April 23**: Resolved persistent database schema and data type issues (`posts.timestamp`, `quotes.last_used`).
- **April 23-24**: Addressed Twitter API rate limiting issues through interval adjustments and result limiting.

### 2. Configuration Externalization
- **April 24**: Moved hardcoded configuration values (intervals, API keys, LLM parameters, content weights, thresholds) from Python modules (`scheduler_engine`, `scheduler_tasks`, `database`, `news_fetcher`, `news_analyzer`) to environment variables for better deployment flexibility via Heroku Config Vars.

### 3. Groq LLM API Integration
- **April 22-24**: Integrated the Groq API client (`llama3-8b-8192` model) directly into `NewsAnalyzer` for content summarization and sentiment analysis.
- **April 24**: Removed obsolete local Ollama integration code (`llm_integration.py`, `llm_api.py`) and related UI components.

### 4. Initial Testing & Deployment
- **April 23-24**: Successfully deployed fixes and verified core functionality (scheduled tweet posting, price updates, basic news analysis) on Heroku. Confirmed stability of `worker` and `web` dynos.

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Enhanced Content Generation & Analysis (Completed: May 2024)

Building on the stable foundation, this phase focused on improving the quality and relevance of generated content and establishing better monitoring.

### 1. ‚úÖ Refine `NewsAnalyzer` & Prompts
- Improved prompt engineering for `analyze_content` in `NewsAnalyzer` for more nuanced summaries and sentiment scores.
- Enhanced processing of LLM responses for better sentiment and significance data.

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhance `TweetHandler` Logic
- Refined the logic for selecting news items based on significance (sentiment score, keywords).
- Improved tweet formatting based on sentiment analysis results.
- Externalized configuration from `tweet_handler.py` for better maintainability.

### 3. ‚úÖ Basic Sentiment Trend Tracking 
- Modified database schema to properly store sentiment and significance scores.
- Added visualization of sentiment trends to the `/admin` panel (v149).

### 4. ‚úÖ Improve Monitoring & Observability

   * **Mitigation**: Faster analysis cycles (balanced with rate limits), robust sentiment analysis, potentially manual override capabilities (Phase 6).

## üîÑ Iterative Development Approach

This roadmap will follow an agile development methodology with:

- Focus on delivering value incrementally.
- Regular reviews of progress and priorities.
- Continuous integration and deployment via Heroku.
- Adapting plans based on performance data and feedback.

Each phase builds on the learnings from previous phases, with the flexibility to adjust priorities.
